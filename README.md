cqlp-mobile
===========
Mobile application of www.cestquoilepire.fr.
This is part of a project for my school, I wanted to use GitHub so that everyone can check my code and, why not, improve it.
Any advice is warmly welcome.
===========

Fetch a random dilemma -> show it in web app -> send back to server the choice -> show the result in web app.

TODO :
- Improve CSS
- Adapt the webservice for this app. (severside)
- Create a view that shows the dilemma, another that shows the results
- Find a secure way to send the "vote" (avoid multiple vote on the same dilemma)

Future improvements:
- Allow users to log in and subscribe
- Allow logged users to like/dislike a dilemma
- Panel to see top dilemmas / most voted dilemmas / top members, as seen in website's homepage.
